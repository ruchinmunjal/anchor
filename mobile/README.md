## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed and configured.
-   An Android or iOS device/emulator.
-   A running instance of the Anchor Server (see root README).

### Installation

1.  Navigate to the mobile directory:
    ```bash
    cd mobile
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  Run code generation (for Riverpod, Drift, JSON serialization):
    ```bash
    dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```

4.  Run the app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

### Connecting to Server

On the first launch, the app will ask for your **Server URL**.
-   If running locally on Android Emulator, use `http://10.0.2.2:3000`
-   If running locally on iOS Simulator, use `http://localhost:3000`
-   If self-hosted, use your deployed URL (e.g., `https://anchor.yourdomain.com`)
